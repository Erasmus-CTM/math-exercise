# Author your first activity

Start with [the rendered examples](https://erasmus-ctm.github.io/math-exercise/). The extension setup is described
separately in [Installation and setup](installation.md).

[Example source — download and open in your editor](https://github.com/Erasmus-CTM/math-exercise/blob/feature/shared-feedback-integration/example.qmd).
Use GitHub’s **Download raw file** button and open the file in an editor such as
**VS Code**. [Getting all the accompanying files](example-source.md).

## Give students something to work on

Copy this activity into your Quarto page and adapt its task to your lesson.

````markdown
```{math-exercise}
#| label: balance-equation
For $3x+2=14$, enter $x=$ _[4].
```
````

The marker `_[4]` becomes an answer field, with 4 as the expected answer. Change the equation and answer together. For algebra, decide whether equivalent expressions should be accepted or whether students must use a particular form.

## Try it as a student

Make a plausible mistake, then correct it. Does the task give enough information?
Does the feedback help with the next step? Try a correct response as well as an
incomplete one. Adjust the instructions until the activity supports the learning
goal you had in mind.

## Choose the kind of help

A *feedback policy* is a named set of instructions for the help you want to offer.
For example, you might want a question during practice and a fuller explanation
afterwards. Put the instructions in a file such as `feedback.yml`:

```yaml
ai-feedback:
  policies:
    gentle-coach:
      max-words: 120
      steps:
        - prompt: Ask one useful question without giving the answer.
        - prompt: Explain the relevant idea and suggest a next step.
```

Load it in the page's front matter:

```yaml
ai-feedback:
  page-policy-files: feedback.yml
```

Select it in an exercise with `#| feedback-policy: gentle-coach`.
Keep the instructions in YAML; the exercise contains only their name. You can
reuse the same instructions in many activities. Each successful Feedback request
moves to the next hint, and the final hint repeats. A new Check or Run starts
the sequence again by default.

## Help feedback stay close to your lesson

Feedback normally uses nearby explanatory text. Put the method or terminology
you have taught before the activity. For a particular definition or formula,
you can select a named passage instead. Use `context: none` when the activity
should stand on its own (on text activities, write `context="none"`). For
Python exploration, use `feedback-context` to distinguish this from execution
settings. [Detailed context options](reference.md).

## Let students ask for feedback

With the default **Copy prompt** setting, Feedback prepares a message containing
the task and current response. Copy it into an AI chat you already use. For a
reply inside the exercise page, use the AI service arranged for your course;
the connection details are in the [setup guide](installation.md).
